# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING in the class directory: class_dmeff_rui_used. That is a repository that points to the current online version of dmeff CLASS.  Also DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING in rui_camb.py file.
